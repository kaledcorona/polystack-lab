> A slick, config-driven framework for multiview and multimodal experiments. Snap in datasets, views, and models, then let it rip with Polystack's stacking magic. Minimal fuss, maximum flex.

Polystack Laboratory implements a data agnostic framework that is plug-and-play, already defines a set of views for each modality and allows the user to configure the experiments using a yaml config file. 

Its intended use is for research projects that need to test different combinations of views, compare them, and iterate through multiple runs of the experiment.
